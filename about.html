<h1>About Us</h1> 

<p>We are a small typewriter repair shop located in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1978, our mission is to preserve and honor the art of typewriting. Through repair, restoration, and sales, we aim to keep classic typewriters in working order for future generations to enjoy.</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>What started as a part-time hobby repairing antique typewriters in our garage quickly grew into a full-fledged business. By the late 1980s, we had expanded our inventory to include refurbished and collectible typewriters for sale. We've watched trends in technology come and go, but our passion for the craft of typewriting remains strong.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

<p>Our services include complete restoration, repair, cleaning and adjustment of all major typewriter brands from the late 19th century through the 1980s. We also curate a collection of restored vintage and antique typewriters for sale. Whether you need parts or repairs for your treasured family heirloom or are looking for your first typewriter, we have you covered.</p> 

<h2>Our Values</h2> 

<p>Preservation, craftsmanship and education are at the core of what we do. We take pride in bringing old machines back to their original working condition. It's important to us to keep the art of typewriting alive and to pass on typewriter history to new generations.</p>

<h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
